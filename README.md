# SoSciSoCi-SSC

The SoSciSoCi Silver Standard Corpus (SSC) was created as a pre-training corpus for the identification of software usage statements in social science publications using the data programming tool [Snorkel](https://www.snorkel.org/). The corpus consists of the methods sections from over 50.000 articles from PLoS indexed with the key word `Social Science`.

The files are split up between positive and negative samples and represented in a line-wise BIO-format. 

The Corpus is described and used in the following publication:

David Schindler and Benjamin Zapilko and Frank Kr√ºger:
*Investigating Software Usage in the Social Sciences: A Knowledge Graph Approach*,
In Proceedings of the 17th Extended Semantic Web Conference,
Heraklion, Crete, Greece,
May 31 - June 4 2020

Please cite this publication, when using the corpus.
